# todolist
### About
--------
The aim of this project is to practice NodeJS, Express and mongoDB, aside with jQuery, by creating a todo list.

### How does it work ?
---------------------
The user has a text input. He writes a task he has to do. When he press the submit button, then the task is stored in a mongoDB database. Then, when the users hovers a todolist item, he has the possibility to modify it or to mark it as done. If it is the case, the element became crossed.
